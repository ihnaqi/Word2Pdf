# Word to PDF using Java

With the help of this program you can use your word file in any format wheter it is written in [Libre Writer](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/) or [Microsoft Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/word) or any other, to convert them into _pdf_.

### A list of Java APIs have been used

The java apis which have been used can be found under the [lib](https://github.com/ihnaqi/Word2Pdf/tree/main/lib) folder which I have deliberately ignored to exclude in [.gitignore](https://github.com/ihnaqi/Word2Pdf/blob/main/.gitignore).

- [Apache POI](https://poi.apache.org/download.html#POI-5.2.3) is used to read _Word_ file in _Java_, there might be other such files out there but to my knowledge it is easy to understand, at least among what I have come across.

- [iText PDF](https://itextpdf.com/resources/api-documentation/itext-7-java) is another [API](https://www.javatpoint.com/api-full-form) which enables us to generate a _PDF_ file in java language.
